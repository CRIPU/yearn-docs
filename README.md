# 紹介

Yearn Financeは、分散型金融（DeFi）のプロダクト一式です。

プロトコルはそれぞれの開発者によって維持され、YFIホルダーによって統治されています。

Yearnのコアプロダクトの簡単な説明、ガバナンスプロセス、活発なコミュニケーションへのチャンネルリンクが以下に記載されています。

## コアプロダクト

### Vaults

Capital pools that automatically generate yield based on opportunities present in the market. Vaults benefit users by socializing gas costs, automating the yield generation and rebalancing process, and automatically shifting capital as opportunities arise. End users also do not need to have a proficient knowledge of the underlying protocols involved or DeFi, thus the Vaults represent a passive-investing strategy.

### Earn

The first Yearn product was a lending aggregator. Funds are shifted between dYdX, AAVE, and Compound automatically as interest rates change between these protocols. Users can deposit to these lending aggregator smart contracts via the Earn page. This product completely optimizes the interest accrual process for end-users to ensure they are obtaining the highest interest rates at all times among the platforms specified above.

## Governance

The Yearn ecosystem is controlled by YFI token holders who submit and vote on off-chain proposals that govern the ecosystem. Proposals that generate a majority support \(&gt;50% of the vote\) are implemented by a 9 member multi-signature wallet. Changes must be signed by 6 out of the 9 wallet signers in order to be implemented. The members of the multi-signature wallet were voted in by YFI holders and are subject to change from future governance votes. Please refer to our FAQ for [the list of the multisig signers](https://docs.yearn.finance/resources/faq#who-is-on-the-multisig) and more information about the [governance process](https://docs.yearn.finance/resources/faq#governance).
